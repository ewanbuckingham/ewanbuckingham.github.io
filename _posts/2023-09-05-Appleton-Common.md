## Introduction

To reach Appleton Common from Oxford threads through the gravel tracks and BOATs above Brookes University's Hinksey Hill campus before threading through the narrow bridleways in Tubney Woods.

Appleton Common sits adjacent to the river Thames and provides more technical riding that is rooty and wet. There are a variety of lines to choose from before riding through Appleton Village and reversing your steps back home.

## Amenities

[Appleton Community Shop]("https://www.appleton-eaton-pc.gov.uk/amenities/appleton-community-shop/") is a local volunteer-run iniative that provides a wide range of snacks, hot and cold drinks, and other goods. It is set back from the road with seating on grass in front of the shop and space for bike parking.

> The store is a short ride to the left when you reach the cross-roads after completing the Appleton Common section.

The [White Hart]("https://www.whitehart-fyfield.com") in Fyfield has a large outdoor seating area with space to lock up bikes away from the road.

## Starting

Begin in North Hinksey on the West side of Oxford where a short climb uphill alongside Raleigh Park (sadly no bridleways) brings you to the Brookes University Hinksey Hill campus and the first gravel setion.

From here, ride on gravelled farm tracks through to Henwood taking care when the track narrows since there often large rocks hidden in the long grass.

At Henwood, turn right then immediately left to follow the BOAT across towards the Bessels Leigh road. This is fast riding on a good surface.

The worst part of the route then follows. An unavoidable 1km along the A420 Faringdon road. It's wide at this point with plenty of room for traffic to pass however there's a shared use path on the other side if you'd prefer not to ride that part.

Continue until you the road widens to become a dual carriage way where you turn immediately left into Rowleigh Lane. This junction is somewhat hidden by a hedge and a bus stop and very easy to miss.

Follow Rowleigh lane until it ends in front of a set of large gates then turn right onto the bridleway.

>**The junction is unmarked and easy to miss** The bridleway drops down the bank on the right-hand side and skirts along the outside of property boundary to access Tubney Woods.

Once in the woods the riding is well trodden bare earth trails through mixed woodland. There are a variety of lines to choose from and many unofficial paths threading back and forth between them.

Leave the woods and join the road and ride alongside Tubney golf course and through the picturesque village itself. At the far end of the village as you approach the junction for the dual carriageway take a sharp left turn onto a shared-use path that runs alongside it before providing pedestrian and cycle access to Fyfield through a tunnel below the roadway.

In Fyfield, ride past the [White Hart]("https://www.whitehart-fyfield.com") pub and take the right turn to Netherton on quiet back roads. Continue to the next junction then cross straight over to start the next off road section on a good gravel track that becomes rougher as the descent steepens to a field gate.

 Beyond the gate the track narrows and you ride bridleway field margins towards Appleton Common. There are often livestock in these fields and it's easy to miss the Second World War observation posts in the field on your left while watching the cattle on your right.

Take the sharp right turn towards Appleton Woods (unless you fancy a swim, in which case carry straight on to the footbridge across to the Thames Path).

Once in Appleton Common Woods you have multiple options depending on the ground conditions and your ambition. The woods are often wet providing slippy roots, muddy wallows and deceptively tricky steps even when the surrounding trails are baked hard in mid summer.

> Located alongside the Thames the woods can and do flood in winter.

The trails eventually converge on a narrow ridged bridge and then follow gravel tracks alongside river. Continue until the track ends in Appleton close to the Tennis clubs and then turn immediately right to follow a short section of bridleway behind houses to a cross roads in the centre of the village. The Community shop is a short ride along the road to the left if you need refreshments. Otherwise continue straight ahead on Oaksmere Road to meet the A420. Use the pedestrian island to the right of the junction to cross the road and cut through the woods to the Ridgeway which will return you to Tubney Woods.

Woods never look the same in the opposite direction and this on is no exception. There is a marker showing where the bridleway you came in on joins but it is set back and not always obvious. Miss it and you'll repeat part of your outward loop before having to double-back. Fortunately it's some nice riding.

Once you've successfully found the junction the navigational challenges are over. Simply follow the path back to Rowleigh lane and along until you meet the A420. For convenience and a quiet life I tend to cross over and ride on the shared-use path here rather than the road (I often seem to come through at rush hour). There's a pedestrian island that'll help you cross back at Bessels Leigh where you can make the short ride up hill to the start of the BOAT at the next junction (turn left then immediately right into the field access).

At the end of the BOAT turn right then left after 25m to access the bridleway. This gives you a final opportunity to dodge half-visible rocks before you join the gravel tracks and ride easily back across to the Brookes University campus. A swift decent of the hill brings you back to North Hinksey and your starting point.
