Hi There, 


I'm Ewan. I'm interested in evidence-based product design and management through data mining and visualisation using Python and R. I'm currently working on a range of innovation projects for [The Open University]("https://www.open.ac.uk") in the fields of:

* Augmented collaboration environments
* Adaptive and predictive analytics
* Learning behavioural insight
* User-centric service design

If you have an interest in these areas, it would be great to hear from you.
